# Ship-Detection-In-SAR-Images-With-Complex-Backgrounds
Ship Detection In SAR Images With  Complex Backgrounds project including codes, report docs and article.

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of the most important active imaging systems in remote sensing. Since SAR is not affected by clouds, day and night, it gives the best images that can be used in ship detection. In this project, the structure of the SAR dataset, which was obtained from Sentinel-1 and Gaofen-3 satellites and composed of approximately 40,000 images, was tried to be explained. Deep learning algorithms fitting for ship detection from the dataset have been decided. First, different versions of the YOLO algorithm (v3Tiny, v4, v5) were used for ship detection. Then these algorithms were compared among themselves in terms of speed and performance using certain parameters like average precision (AP), average recall (AR) and detection time. SSD-MobileNet, EfficientDet D0 and Faster R-CNN algorithms were added to these comparisons and the most suitable algorithm for ship detection was tried to be found.
